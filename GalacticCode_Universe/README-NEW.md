# Galactic Code Universe 🚀

Enterprise-grade galactic codebase with Infinicorecipher integration for maximum security and scalability.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This repository follows a modern, enterprise-grade structure with:

- **Core Infrastructure**: Cryptographic security, networking, data management
- **Microservices**: Scalable service architecture with encrypted communications
- **Multi-Platform Applications**: Web, Unity, and mobile clients
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform and Kubernetes configurations
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit, integration, security, and performance tests

## 🔐 Security

Built with **Infinicorecipher** integration providing:
- Configurable encryption strength (2^16 to 2^62 bits)
- Multiple security profiles (Development, Staging, Production, High-Security)
- End-to-end encryption for all communications
- Built-in authentication and key rotation

   .\create_config_files.ps1
   ```

3. **Migrate Existing Files**:
   ```powershell
   .\migrate_existing_files.ps1
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Start Development Environment**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
